            <h2>Korean War</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">The Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, was a conflict between North Korea, backed by communist allies like the Soviet Union and China, and South Korea, 
                supported by the United Nations, primarily the United States. The war began on June 25, 1950, when North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel, aiming to unify the Korean Peninsula under communist rule. 
                This invasion triggered a massive international response, with the U.N. quickly mobilizing forces to aid South Korea. The early stages of the war saw rapid advances and retreats on both sides, with Seoul changing hands multiple times.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The war marked a significant period in Cold War history, as it pitted communist and capitalist forces against one another, with neither side able to claim a decisive victory. 
                The conflict reached a stalemate by mid-1951, with both sides entrenched near the 38th parallel. After two years of grueling combat and failed peace negotiations, 
                the war finally ended with an armistice signed on July 27, 1953. While the armistice brought an end to the active fighting, no formal peace treaty was signed, 
                meaning the Korean Peninsula remains technically at war to this day, with a heavily militarized border separating North and South Korea.</p>
