Grad Project (First time using github for a project as an individual)

Project goal was to create a website that we found intresting. The Website had to have a seperate html and css file in addition to the following

**Header, Nav, Footer
***Table
**Form w/Submission confirmation
****Some javascript in cluded somewhere in site
*****website had to be broken up into 6-10 pages

The project was called HeartOfSeoul and contains the mentioend above in addtion to basic javascript code, printing and downloading buttons, a collaspe and exand table, and navagation.

Any feedback is appreciated as this was my first real "in-depth" HTML and CSS project
