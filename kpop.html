                <h2>Korean Pop (KPOP)</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">K-pop, short for Korean pop music, has become a global phenomenon that not only defines South Korea’s 
                    music scene but also plays a significant role in shaping its modern culture. Originating in the early 
                    1990s, K-pop has grown into an industry that blends catchy melodies, intricate choreography, and highly 
                    polished performances.</p> 
                    
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The genre is known for its fusion of various musical styles, such as hip-hop, 
                    R&B, and electronic dance music, and is complemented by its visual aesthetics in music videos and stage performances. 
                    K-pop groups like BTS, BLACKPINK, and EXO have gained international acclaim, expanding South Korea's cultural footprint across the globe. 
                    This international success has boosted the nation’s soft power, positioning South Korea as a key player in global pop culture.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The influence of K-pop on Korean culture extends beyond music. It has impacted fashion, language, 
                    and even social attitudes, particularly among the younger generations. The iconic style of K-pop idols often sets trends, inspiring 
                    fans in Korea and abroad to emulate their looks and lifestyles. Additionally, the “Hallyu” or Korean Wave, driven largely by K-pop, has 
                    played a central role in promoting other aspects of Korean culture, such as food, dramas, and tourism.</p>
                    
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">K-pop has also encouraged conversations around mental health, societal pressures, and issues like self-expression, 
                    breaking some of the more traditional norms in Korean society. Thus, K-pop is not just entertainment; it's a cultural force that shapes identities 
                    and bridges Korea with the world.</p>
